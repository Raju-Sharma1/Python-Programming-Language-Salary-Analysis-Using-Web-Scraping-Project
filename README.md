# Python-Programming-Language-Salary-Analysis-Using-Web-Scraping-Project
This project demonstrates web scraping and data extraction techniques using Python. The objective was to extract programming language salary data from an HTML webpage, process the information, and generate a structured CSV dataset for further analysis.

# Objective
To scrape programming language salary information from an online HTML table and convert the unstructured web data into a clean, structured dataset.

# Tools & Technologies Used
1. Python
2. Requests (HTTP requests)
3. BeautifulSoup (Web Scraping)
4. Pandas (Data Processing & Export)
5. NumPy

# Project Workflow
1. Sent an HTTP request to retrieve webpage content
2. Parsed HTML using BeautifulSoup
3. Located and extracted table data
4. Extracted programming language names and average salary values
5. Cleaned and structured data using Pandas
6. Removed unwanted header rows
7. Exported processed data into a CSV file

# Output
The final output file:
📁 popular_languages.csv

The dataset contains:
1. Programming Language
2. Average Salary

# Key Insights
1. Popular programming languages show varying salary trends
2. Data extraction from HTML tables enables structured salary comparison
3. Web scraping can automate labor market and compensation analysis

# Business Value
This project demonstrates how web scraping can be used to collect market data for salary benchmarking, career planning, and workforce analysis. It highlights practical skills in transforming unstructured web data into usable analytical datasets.
